# Currency rate challenge

## Description

This project exposes an endpoint displaying the currency rate of USD
against EUR. The data is fetched from the the Frankfurter API.


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9.1
- (Optional) Virtualenv
- (Optional) Docker

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tiagoc98/currency-rate.git
    cd currency-rate/currency-rate
    ```
#### Without Docker

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the database:

    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

#### With Docker
2. Run the following command while in the directory of the Dockerfile to build the Docker image:

    ```sh
    docker build -t currency-rate .
    ```

3. Start the container after the build is complete:

    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 currency-rate
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Development Server Without Docker

1. Start the Django development server:

    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
### Features
1. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/rate/` to see the app running and the latest currency rate of USD against EUR.

2. To search for the rate in a specific date go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/rate/<yyyy-mm-dd>/ to show the rate on that day

3. To search for the rate in a specific date go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/rate/<yyyy-mm-dd>/<yyyy-mm-dd>/ to show the average during the dates

4. Some dates are missing in the chronology of the data provided by Frankfurter API. To calculate the average as close as possible to
the real values the previous available value is used for that rate. For example the previous available rate for the date of 2024-01-01 is the rate of 2023-12-29

### Running Tests

1. Run the test suite:

    ```sh
    python manage.py test
    ```
